                        <p class="breakk"> Imagine having wonderfully smooth legs all day, all night and never having to rush out to buy razors, wax or hair removal creams. Imagine never having to worry about the tedious and time consuming task of waxing and shaving.</p>

                        <p class="breakk">Enjoy the luxury of having smooth legs, bikini line and under arms every day, in the conquest for hair-freedom. Whether it’s for a big event or just your day-to-day life, laser hair removal can benefit all.</p>

                        <p class="breakk">Laser hair removal works by using a laser light, which generates heat to damage or destroy the hair follicles. The process is painless and very effective, and takes less than an hour per visit. It is used across the world by both men and women. Almost all hair types can be removed, although we always carry out a "patch test" to ensure you do not suffer any adverse reactions.</p>

<h3 class="heading__para">WHAT AREAS CAN BE TREATED?</h3>
<p class="breakk">Most body areas can be treated with laser hair removal including:

<p class="breakk">Face
<p class="breakk">Arms
<p class="breakk">Chest
<p class="breakk">Nipples
<p class="breakk">Back
<p class="breakk">Hands
<p class="breakk">Pubic region
<p class="breakk">Legs (thighs and lower legs)
<p class="breakk">Laser treatments can also treat ingrowing hairs.

<h3 class="heading__para">SO HOW DOES LASER HAIR REMOVAL WORK?</h3>
<p class="breakk">The light passes through the outer layers of skin and is selectively absorbed by the melanin pigment in the hair follicle. The light energy heats the pigment and effectively disables the hair follicle without damaging the surrounding cells.</p>

<p class="breakk">It is important to note that lasers are effective in removing hairs, which are in the growing (Anagen) phase. Follicles in the second phase (Categen), and third phase (Telagen), will not be affected since the dermal papilla, or root, of the follicle is not yet attached to the follicle itself. Due to the hair growth cycle, additional treatments will be required once the dormant hairs reach the Anagen phase.</p>

<h3 class="heading__para">HOW MANY LASER HAIR REMOVAL TREATMENTS WOULD I NEED?</h3>
<p class="breakk">The number of treatments vary depending on a multiple of factors: the thickness of the hair; the area being treated; and your hair growth cycle. Most clients usually require a minimum course of 5 treatments. To ensure hair in each stage of the growth cycle are disabled there tends to be a five to eight week interval between each course of treatment. During your Free Consultation, our qualified medical aestheticians will assess your requirements and indicate how many treatments will be needed.</p>

<p class="heading__para">WILL THE LASER HAIR REMOVAL TREATMENT HURT?</h3>
<p class="breakk">No. Laser hair removal is predominantly painless. The procedure is safe, fast and effective.</p>

<p class="breakk">Mild redness may occur on the treated area but this will only last for a short period.</p>

<h3 class="heading__para">HOW MUCH DOES LASER HAIR REMOVAL COST?</h3>
<p class="breakk">The exact price and duration of the treatment depends on many factors and can only be properly determined by our qualified medical aestheticians during your free consultation.</p>

<p class="breakk">Fabulously smooth skin day after day, is just a phone call away…</p>
