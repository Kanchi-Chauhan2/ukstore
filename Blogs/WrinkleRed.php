                    <p class="breakk">Simply, safely and effectively improve frown lines, forehead creases and 'crows feet'.</p>

                    <p class="breakk">This procedure can have remarkable results in improving the wrinkles resulting from hyperactive facial muscles. It is used to treat frown lines between the eyebrows, horizontal forehead lines and ‘crows feet’ around the eyes.</p>

                    <p class="breakk">After the treatment, the muscles will relax and the skin will smooth out over about 5 days.</p>

                    <p class="breakk">The result is a softer, more relaxed and pleasant appearance. The effect usually lasts about six months and can be repeated when needed. Most patients require less frequent treatments over time as the muscles ‘retrain’ and weaken from disuse.</p>

                    <p class="breakk">This treatment can be very effective in enhancing the results of N-lite IPL treatment for collagen production and may be used in combination with Micro Dermabrasion or glycolic peels. It is one of the most popular ‘mini treatments’ available. The procedure can be done on a lunch break and requires no anaesthesia or recovery time.</p>

                    <p class="breakk">Our clinic will be able to advise which would be the best treatment to use for your particular circumstances</p>
