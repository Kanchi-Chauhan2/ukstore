                    According to the US National Library of Medicine research, Out of 600 surveyed women in South Africa mostly African and Indian ancestries, “32.7% reported using skin lightening products” (Dermatol BR J). Women have put their own health at risk by using cosmetic products containing mercury, hydroquinone, and corticosteroids especially after knowing the facts about the harmful effects caused by these products.

<p class="break">breakAnother culture that is very conscious about skin lightening is the Chinese culture (among other Asian cultures). Although the modern revelation of brighter skin may date back to ancient China as women considered to be beautiful with physical characteristics such as black lustrous hair, pale skin, bright expressive eyes, and light elegant gait.</p>

<p class="break">In recent times, to attain favorite skin tone, people are more inclined to use skin-bleaching products made available by those who want to exploit the desire for fairer skin. Meanwhile, it has increasingly become more important to choose skin-lightening products wisely and be aware of the ingredients that are safe and contain non-allergic chemicals, whilst understanding when and why it is adequate to apply such ointments.</p>

<p class="break">The most common skin lightener, hydroquinone is not uniformly safe and has been banned in Europe while the FDA is proposing to ban it in the US since hydroquinone causes rashes and may also result in skin cancer. Moreover, it is always advisable to be steering clear of any skin lightener that contains steroids, as some are so potent that they can even suppress our immune systems.</p>

<p class="break">According to Dr. Arthur Perry (NY, USA), “when you see a dramatic change in skin color of celebrities, it is mainly because they undertake laser or chemical peels, or use a drug called Benaquin cream. This is a drug that kills pigment-producing cells and is intended as a last-ditch effort to even out the splotches that occurs in that terribly disfiguring disease called vitiligo”.  </p>

<p class="break">Each individual has a unique skin type that means finding the best skin lightening cream is a different experience for different people. Fortunately, there are many harmless products available in the market to achieve skin treatment, depending on one’s goal. For instance, reversing the effects of the sun on your face or getting rid of black spots on the skin. However, depending on the age, one must lookout for products that will both even out the skin tone and help with anti-aging efforts that are rich in vitamin C and moisturizing ingredients such as coconut and olive oils. Other factors while choosing skin cream are the sensitive skin that is prone to irritation and rashes. In that case, one should look for creams with natural ingredients that work to kill bacteria and exfoliate the skin, all while keeping the pores clean. </p>

 

<h3 class="heading__para">BEST ORGANIC SKIN LIGHTENING CREAM</h3>

<p class="break">Chemical brightening agents like hydroquinone blocks key enzymes near melanin (pigment) and help skin to appear brighter. However, recent studies began questioning the safety of hydroquinone as clients were at risk for developing ochronosis, a condition that ironically darkens the skin and causes severe irritation and hyperpigmentation. There are many shops that are switching to hydroquinone-free lightening agents, online stores such as ‘Body Contours’ are mostly focusing on organic products that will brighten and will have no after effect on the skin also helping with problems of skin pigmentation.</p>

<p class="break">Body Contours sells organic lightening cream that comprises natural alternatives to hydroquinone. Some of the natural ingredients in this skin cream include:</p>

<p class="break">LICORICE: It involves two ingredients that help with pigmentation- glabridin and liquiritin. Helping with dark spots, licorice is soothing and can help even out skin tone.</p>

<p class="break">KOJIC ACID:  It is originated from mushroom-like fungi during fermentation and is the second most common natural lightening agent. It forbids the production of melanin and penetrates the upper layers of the skin causing a lightning effect.</p>

<p class="break">VITAMIN C: It is another popular brightening alternative found in brightening serum from Body Contours and is an incredible antioxidant that is favorable for patients with hyperpigmentation. It works by lightening hyperpigmentation spots on the skin, but not brightening regular skin.</p>
